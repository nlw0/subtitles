1
00:00:05,074 --> 00:00:09,076
I'm not going to make a long introduction to this next individual we all know him

2
00:00:09,176 --> 00:00:12,745
 as a true modern day hero

3
00:00:12,888 --> 00:00:17,767
going against the tide, not afraid, fearless

4
00:00:17,867 --> 00:00:21,828
and we are so grateful that he's agreed to join us

5
00:00:21,928 --> 00:00:23,776
Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

6
00:00:23,876 --> 00:00:29,540
[applause]

7
00:00:39,237 --> 00:00:40,785
Thank you everybody

8
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:48,766
I want to thank all of you stalwarts for coming here and I want to thank particularly 

9
00:00:48,866 --> 00:00:55,222
Ron Paul for hosting you, for keeping the flame alive, for his

10
00:00:55,322 --> 00:01:02,321
life-long commitment to civil rights, to the bill of rights

11
00:01:02,421 --> 00:01:09,206
and to the Constitution. There are many many areas and differences in our political opinions over the past

12
00:01:09,306 --> 00:01:12,589
 40 years that both of us have been in politics

13
00:01:12,689 --> 00:01:18,879
both of us share a reverence for the bill of rights, and I think ultimately it's the retreat

14
00:01:18,979 --> 00:01:24,977
fortress where all of us are holding up today

15
00:01:25,954 --> 00:01:31,290
Excuse my voice which usually gets better as I talk

16
00:01:33,792 --> 00:01:40,534
I wanna talk about the thing that we have in common which is the erosion of the Constitution

17
00:01:40,653 --> 00:01:45,465
I gave a speech in Berlin I think last August

18
00:01:45,565 --> 00:01:49,229
In the beginning of the pandemic, where I talked about

19
00:01:49,329 --> 00:01:55,066
Hermann GÃ¶ring's observition at Nuremberg

20
00:01:55,166 --> 00:01:59,926
where he was on trial and eventually executed

21
00:02:00,026 --> 00:02:04,810
He said at that time, he didn't say in Nuremberg transcripts

22
00:02:05,406 --> 00:02:14,101
He said in a private conversation with a psychologist

23
00:02:14,201 --> 00:02:19,152
called Gustave Gilbert who was given access to the prisioners in Nuremberg

24
00:02:19,252 --> 00:02:24,107
And that discrepancy by the way has been exploited by the modern

25
00:02:24,207 --> 00:02:31,016
propaganda juggernaut, "fact-checking" organizations which of course are funded

26
00:02:31,116 --> 00:02:36,471
by Bill Gates, by Facebook, by the medical cartel, by the State Department

27
00:02:36,571 --> 00:02:41,045
saying that he never said these words at Nuremberg,

28
00:02:41,212 --> 00:02:45,024
and it's true he didn't said them in the transcript of Nuremberg

29
00:02:45,124 --> 00:02:48,383
but they were recorded by Gustave Gilbert

30
00:02:48,483 --> 00:02:51,599
and what he said is, Gilbert said to him:

31
00:02:51,699 --> 00:02:54,720
How did you do this to the German people?

32
00:02:54,820 --> 00:03:00,342
And he started explaining all their propaganda techniques

33
00:03:00,442 --> 00:03:03,987
and Gilbert interrupted him and said: "that couldn't happen in a democracy

34
00:03:04,087 --> 00:03:08,604
because there's free choice, there's critical thinking" and he said

35
00:03:08,704 --> 00:03:12,397
"You can do this", Goring said

36
00:03:12,497 --> 00:03:14,993
"You can do this in any system"

37
00:03:15,093 --> 00:03:19,996
"It doesn't matter if it's a democracy, monarchy or a communist system"

38
00:03:20,096 --> 00:03:22,093
"or a fascist system"

39
00:03:22,193 --> 00:03:26,762
"All you need to do is invoke fear"

40
00:03:26,862 --> 00:03:29,550
"You tell the people they're under attack"

41
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:32,527
"that you're the only one who can save them"

42
00:03:32,627 --> 00:03:36,982
"and anybody who disagrees with you is a threat to the commonwealth"

43
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:40,127
"They will do anything that you tell them to do"

44
00:03:41,009 --> 00:03:48,251
And today, you know, Hitler was democratically elected

45
00:03:49,132 --> 00:03:55,398
by the most well-educated people in the planet, a highest level of education

46
00:03:55,498 --> 00:03:58,614
and some of the most tolerant people in Europe at that time

47
00:03:58,714 --> 00:04:01,782
the reason there were so many Jews in Germany

48
00:04:01,882 --> 00:04:07,595
is because they fled. Germany was very bad to the Jews long before Hitler

49
00:04:07,695 --> 00:04:11,426
but much less bad than the eastern-european countries

50
00:04:11,526 --> 00:04:16,767
or Spain or the other countries from which they fled to come to Germany

51
00:04:16,867 --> 00:04:21,318
So you had a people that historically were tolerant

52
00:04:21,418 --> 00:04:24,820
open-minded, questioning and critical

53
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:30,299
and probably the Weimar republic was the strongest democracy in Europe

54
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:33,420
and Hitler was elected, he did not take over

55
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,969
he was elected by people

56
00:04:36,069 --> 00:04:41,496
who he was able... He had 3% of the vote in the previous election

57
00:04:41,596 --> 00:04:44,736
and then he won with a majority

58
00:04:44,836 --> 00:04:48,905
because he was able to manipulate the use of fear

59
00:04:49,005 --> 00:04:52,645
And we've seen one of the alarming parts of this pandemic

60
00:04:52,745 --> 00:04:56,648
for those of us who were a little conversant

61
00:04:56,748 --> 00:05:01,388
with the kind of medical paradigms that are being invoked right now

62
00:05:01,488 --> 00:05:04,914
to understand with such clarity

63
00:05:05,014 --> 00:05:08,917
manipulations that are taking place, the chicanery

64
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:12,847
hiding of real data

65
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:19,566
the obscuring of all these true facts and figures that we could

66
00:05:19,666 --> 00:05:23,115
use to make rational policy decisions

67
00:05:23,215 --> 00:05:25,998
how did case fatality rates

68
00:05:26,098 --> 00:05:30,000
likened to the seasonal flu for each age group?

69
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:33,240
who is dying at what age, who is not?

70
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:37,505
what are the real death counts from covid?

71
00:05:37,605 --> 00:05:41,221
CDC has admitted that 96%

72
00:05:41,888 --> 00:05:49,273
of the people... Only 4% of the people who it classifies

73
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:53,323
as having died from covid died from <i>only</i> covid

74
00:05:53,943 --> 00:06:03,210
and the average of potentially fatal comorbidities in the remaining 96% is 3.8

75
00:06:03,972 --> 00:06:08,523
the people who died, 96% of them had 

76
00:06:08,623 --> 00:06:12,882
almost 4 other reasons that might have killed them

77
00:06:12,982 --> 00:06:18,886
and the manipulation of the death certificates,

78
00:06:18,986 --> 00:06:21,721
manipulation of the PCR test

79
00:06:21,821 --> 00:06:26,199
all of these manipulations that are all designed

80
00:06:26,299 --> 00:06:29,535
the Gates funded projection 

81
00:06:29,635 --> 00:06:35,014
from London and from IHME from Washington

82
00:06:35,114 --> 00:06:38,206
which they used to manipulate the lockdowns

83
00:06:38,306 --> 00:06:41,899
which we now see were 40 times the death rate

84
00:06:41,999 --> 00:06:44,972
that actually was imposed by covid, so

85
00:06:45,072 --> 00:06:48,808
all of these mechanisms appear to have been

86
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:53,191
deliberately manipulated to put our population in a state of fear

87
00:06:53,291 --> 00:06:56,717
and what happens when you have a population in fear

88
00:06:56,817 --> 00:07:01,410
you've the complete obliteration of critical thinking

89
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:08,105
and people stop asking questions, it's a biological impulse

90
00:07:08,205 --> 00:07:12,941
we retreat to the hard-wired impulses

91
00:07:13,041 --> 00:07:19,183
that were hard-wired into us during the 20.000 generations of the human race

92
00:07:19,283 --> 00:07:24,305
was wondering the African savannas, small tribal groups

93
00:07:24,405 --> 00:07:29,998
at war, embattled, besieged all the time, and the only way of survival

94
00:07:30,098 --> 00:07:33,477
was to follow a strong male leader

95
00:07:33,577 --> 00:07:40,385
to embrace a common orthodoxy that would provide unit cohesion

96
00:07:40,485 --> 00:07:47,270
and then to practice blind obedience to the leader

97
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:51,177
and that's where we all go

98
00:07:51,277 --> 00:07:55,180
in times of fear, unless we have something else

99
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,563
that says to us "I'm gonna question this"

100
00:07:58,663 --> 00:08:01,779
"I'm gonna start questioning these things"

101
00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:05,257
And when you start doing that with orthodoxies

102
00:08:05,357 --> 00:08:09,402
now the official orthodoxies, the whole thing falls apart

103
00:08:09,502 --> 00:08:14,619
but we have all seen this kind of bewildering imposition

104
00:08:14,719 --> 00:08:21,624
of totalitarian controls in our society, attacks

105
00:08:21,724 --> 00:08:27,222
on the United States constitution that are unprecedented in the American history

106
00:08:27,322 --> 00:08:31,010
Remember during Civil War

107
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:35,727
Abraham Lincoln tried to abandon <i>habeas corpus</i> just one

108
00:08:35,827 --> 00:08:40,206
provision of the United States constitution, the courts said "you can't do that"

109
00:08:40,306 --> 00:08:47,091
there is no emergency exemption in the United States constitution

110
00:08:47,191 --> 00:08:50,354
and there's certainly no pandemic exemption

111
00:08:50,454 --> 00:08:56,239
and it's not that our frames didn't know about pandemics

112
00:08:56,339 --> 00:09:00,217
there was a pandemic during the Revolutionary War

113
00:09:00,317 --> 00:09:07,031
of smallpox, that brought the army of New England to a standstill for 3 months

114
00:09:07,912 --> 00:09:13,034
and the all knew about it. There was another pandemic during the

115
00:09:13,134 --> 00:09:17,465
American Revolution of malaria and Washington, ironically

116
00:09:17,565 --> 00:09:24,422
used bark of the cinchona tree, which the modern analog is hydroxychloroquine, to end that pandemic

117
00:09:26,804 --> 00:09:33,094
and so they knew what pandemics were, but they didn't put it in the United States constitution

118
00:09:33,194 --> 00:09:38,335
that all of these rights will be suspended as soon as we have a pandemic

119
00:09:38,435 --> 00:09:43,552
and James Madison said:

120
00:09:43,652 --> 00:09:50,699
"the reason we put the right to free speech in the first ammendment,

121
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:56,059
is because all of the other civil rights, human rights, constitutional rights

122
00:09:56,159 --> 00:09:57,989
are based upon it"

123
00:09:58,089 --> 00:10:02,934
If a government can hide what he's doing by censoring its opponents

124
00:10:03,034 --> 00:10:05,452
and silencing dissidents

125
00:10:05,552 --> 00:10:08,958
it has license to do anything that it wants

126
00:10:09,315 --> 00:10:10,315
so they got rid

127
00:10:10,415 --> 00:10:12,668
they conspired with the social media

128
00:10:12,768 --> 00:10:16,598
and the media, we now know, we have the emails that show

129
00:10:16,698 --> 00:10:19,117
Fauci corresponding with Zuckerberg

130
00:10:19,217 --> 00:10:21,976
telling him what to shut down and what not to shut down

131
00:10:22,741 --> 00:10:26,298
and they shut down

132
00:10:26,398 --> 00:10:28,085
the critics and once they did that

133
00:10:28,185 --> 00:10:30,875
once they imposed censorship

134
00:10:30,975 --> 00:10:35,657
and they close the debate off from public square

135
00:10:35,757 --> 00:10:38,329
they were able to go after all the other ammendments

136
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:41,085
so went after religious freedoms

137
00:10:41,185 --> 00:10:42,923
they closed the churches

138
00:10:43,023 --> 00:10:47,211
in this country, every church in this country for a year

139
00:10:47,311 --> 00:10:52,044
and they kept the liquor stores open as essential businesses

140
00:10:53,048 --> 00:10:58,442
there's no protection of liquor stores in the United States constitution

141
00:10:59,293 --> 00:11:01,318
there is protection of churches

142
00:11:01,418 --> 00:11:05,015
and they abolished religious exemptions

143
00:11:05,305 --> 00:11:08,881
they got rid of jury trials, one of the first things that they did

144
00:11:08,981 --> 00:11:13,020
the 7th amendment right to jury trials, the 7th amendment says:

145
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,154
"under no conditions

146
00:11:16,254 --> 00:11:19,969
will Americans be denied their right

147
00:11:20,069 --> 00:11:25,589
to a trial by their peers in maters exceeding 25 dollars in value"

148
00:11:25,689 --> 00:11:30,494
and anybody who claims, any corporation

149
00:11:30,594 --> 00:11:36,694
that claims to be implementing a counter-measure is now immune from lawsuits

150
00:11:36,794 --> 00:11:41,105
no matter if it's a vaccine maker, remdesivir maker

151
00:11:41,205 --> 00:11:43,523
no matter how negligent that company is

152
00:11:43,623 --> 00:11:46,010
no matter how reckless

153
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:49,740
grievous your injury or death

154
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:52,107
you cannot sue them

155
00:11:52,207 --> 00:11:56,161
and that again is novel in American history

156
00:11:56,261 --> 00:11:59,925
all these companies now, and I saw it yesterday

157
00:12:00,025 --> 00:12:03,127
in the Theranos lawsuit

158
00:12:03,227 --> 00:12:08,781
that the judge has banned unvaccinated jurors

159
00:12:08,881 --> 00:12:14,265
and that ultimately we all know is now a political

160
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:19,630
implication, because you're getting rid of all the black jurors

161
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:24,484
a highest... 70% of blacks are unvaccinated

162
00:12:24,584 --> 00:12:27,278
and you're getting rid of any juror

163
00:12:27,378 --> 00:12:29,832
who knows how to do critical thinking

164
00:12:32,081 --> 00:12:38,229
[applause]

165
00:12:38,329 --> 00:12:43,645
they got rid of the rights of association

166
00:12:43,745 --> 00:12:45,382
rights of assembly

167
00:12:45,482 --> 00:12:50,100
by telling us we have to social distance from each other, we can't gather in crowds

168
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,200
imagine this

169
00:12:52,076 --> 00:12:55,005
They got rid of property rights

170
00:12:55,105 --> 00:12:59,535
they closed every business, a milion businesses in this country

171
00:12:59,635 --> 00:13:02,944
without due process and without just compensation

172
00:13:03,044 --> 00:13:06,570
in direct violation of the constitution

173
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:09,124
They got rid of

174
00:13:09,224 --> 00:13:14,847
due process, notice and rule-making, we know how we pass rules in this country

175
00:13:14,947 --> 00:13:17,061
In a democracy,

176
00:13:17,161 --> 00:13:19,105
congress can pass rules

177
00:13:19,205 --> 00:13:26,156
They can vote, they can deliberate as they see fit. A regulatory agency cannot do that

178
00:13:27,246 --> 00:13:29,204
And the executive cannot do that

179
00:13:29,304 --> 00:13:35,268
because the courts, and we all are freightened to death we're creating these unelected officials

180
00:13:35,506 --> 00:13:38,299
We have to have some democratic control, you know

181
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:44,226
And I've been suing people for 40 years, governments, the EPA, the Interior Department

182
00:13:44,326 --> 00:13:46,509
all the state EPAs

183
00:13:46,609 --> 00:13:53,134
for doing kind of regulatory favors for industry without going through the regulatory process

184
00:13:53,543 --> 00:14:00,815
Here's what you have to do when you pass a regulation, you have to propose a rule, you have to publish a proposed rule

185
00:14:00,915 --> 00:14:04,579
Here's what we're gonna do, we're gonna get everybody to put on a mask

186
00:14:04,679 --> 00:14:07,628
you have to publish an environmental impact statement

187
00:14:07,728 --> 00:14:11,924
a regulatory impact statement and an economic impact statement saying

188
00:14:12,024 --> 00:14:15,507
here's the science we used to support that rule

189
00:14:15,607 --> 00:14:18,285
here's the justification for it

190
00:14:18,385 --> 00:14:20,891
here's the people who we heard

191
00:14:20,991 --> 00:14:25,040
and the financial cost to those people, and other cost

192
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:32,618
here are the group... here are the advantages and the benefits of that rule. It all has to be quantified

193
00:14:32,718 --> 00:14:38,585
and then they have to give the public a chance to comment, notice and comment

194
00:14:38,685 --> 00:14:42,785
the public then writes in and says "wait a minute"

195
00:14:43,025 --> 00:14:46,643
"I run a wilderness kayaking group"

196
00:14:46,743 --> 00:14:49,746
"that you're gonna put out of business and destroy"

197
00:14:49,846 --> 00:14:55,113
"and there's no reason masks... there's no science saying masks

198
00:14:55,213 --> 00:14:58,645
"will in these outside settings going to help"

199
00:14:58,745 --> 00:15:01,268
"will you examine my business?"

200
00:15:01,368 --> 00:15:08,520
every business have a right to write in and say we can do this we can do that we can mitigate the risk

201
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:16,561
so let's change the rule to accommodate that, so it's as narrowly tailored as possible, as the law requires

202
00:15:16,661 --> 00:15:17,673
one of that happened

203
00:15:17,773 --> 00:15:20,333
Then you have a public hearing

204
00:15:20,433 --> 00:15:24,654
where Tony Fauci brings in all of his science

205
00:15:24,754 --> 00:15:29,265
that say masks work... None

206
00:15:29,365 --> 00:15:36,024
And all of his scientists he relied on, and he's not going to be able to find one

207
00:15:36,124 --> 00:15:41,507
because we'll destroy them in depositions, and embarrass and humiliate them.

208
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:49,252
[applause]

209
00:15:49,352 --> 00:15:54,964
And then we get to cross-examine them and they are cross-examining ours and then

210
00:15:55,064 --> 00:15:58,642
and the administrative law judge

211
00:15:58,742 --> 00:16:05,490
rewrites the rules and quotes "they aren't arbitrary and capricious" and then recommends them

212
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:10,215
and if they don't reflect the evidence we can sue the agency

213
00:16:10,315 --> 00:16:13,325
so there's all of these democratic protections

214
00:16:13,425 --> 00:16:15,239
all of that was waived

215
00:16:15,339 --> 00:16:18,917
all of these things were imposed on us by <i>fiat</i>

216
00:16:19,017 --> 00:16:22,505
with no discussion, no science cited

217
00:16:22,605 --> 00:16:28,726
and, you know, also all of this track-and-trace

218
00:16:28,826 --> 00:16:35,035
surveillance is violating our right to not have warrant-less searches and seizures

219
00:16:35,135 --> 00:16:37,637
you go through the entire Bill of Rights

220
00:16:37,737 --> 00:16:42,691
and with one exception, the 2nd amendment, they have all been obliterated

221
00:16:42,791 --> 00:16:46,399
and the weird thing to me

222
00:16:46,499 --> 00:16:50,885
is I grew up in a liberal milieu

223
00:16:50,985 --> 00:16:54,683
where everybody I knew was saying

224
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:58,211
"the one thing we gotta do is protect the constitution"

225
00:16:58,311 --> 00:17:01,112
and to have my side

226
00:17:01,212 --> 00:17:05,179
as the ones who are advocating censorship

227
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:09,874
and these kind of controls and erosion and subversion of our

228
00:17:09,974 --> 00:17:14,539
traditional Bill of Rights it's really...

229
00:17:14,639 --> 00:17:17,230
it is surreal

230
00:17:17,330 --> 00:17:22,344
We all read Kafka when growing up, we all read Orwell

231
00:17:22,444 --> 00:17:31,185
we all watched... We read all the Robert Heinlein

232
00:17:31,285 --> 00:17:35,771
all of these stories, these parables

233
00:17:35,871 --> 00:17:40,287
about the imposition of totalitarianism, and none of us...

234
00:17:40,387 --> 00:17:43,307
all of us knew what right was from wrong

235
00:17:43,407 --> 00:17:47,613
and it's bizarre to me to see how people have forgotten those things

236
00:17:47,713 --> 00:17:52,846
One of the things that... I'm writing this book now I'm about to publish this book

237
00:17:52,946 --> 00:17:56,106
on Anthony Fauci, and

238
00:17:56,206 --> 00:18:02,356
part of my journey writing that book --- it's taken me over an year of really intense research, was...

239
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:06,991
it took me into a kind of a journey to try to explain

240
00:18:07,091 --> 00:18:09,892
how this could have happened in America

241
00:18:09,992 --> 00:18:15,245
and one of the things that I discovered during this process

242
00:18:15,345 --> 00:18:21,734
is that this, what's happening now, this lockstep

243
00:18:21,834 --> 00:18:26,638
imposition of totalitarian controls, not just in America

244
00:18:26,738 --> 00:18:33,636
but in every one of the liberal democracies in the world, and all of the other countries in the world

245
00:18:33,736 --> 00:18:37,493
you know, China moved into Hong Kong and banned the last

246
00:18:37,593 --> 00:18:41,919
democratic newspaper. Everywhere in the world we see these

247
00:18:42,019 --> 00:18:45,867
we see liberal democracies and constitutional rights disappearing

248
00:18:45,967 --> 00:18:49,575
and it all happened at once, as if it was planned

249
00:18:49,675 --> 00:18:53,492
and I don't consider myself a conspiracy theorist

250
00:18:53,592 --> 00:18:58,845
and it's though to imagine how anybody could have planned this, but then I stumbled on

251
00:18:58,945 --> 00:19:03,211
these simulations, many of you saw the simulation

252
00:19:03,311 --> 00:19:08,116
that took place in 201, Event 201

253
00:19:08,216 --> 00:19:13,887
in October of 2019, so

254
00:19:13,987 --> 00:19:19,240
we now know the virus started circulating around September 14th

255
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:25,729
so this took place when the virus was already circulating in Wuhan

256
00:19:25,829 --> 00:19:30,275
and the people who took part in that

257
00:19:30,375 --> 00:19:37,362
simulation were the deputy director of the CIA, Avril Haines, who's now

258
00:19:37,462 --> 00:19:41,788
the number one person in control of the National Security Agency under Biden

259
00:19:41,888 --> 00:19:46,214
and Bill Gates, of course, who financed it

260
00:19:46,314 --> 00:19:48,845
people from the social media

261
00:19:48,945 --> 00:19:53,959
groups, people from the biggest pharmaceutical companies, Johnson & Johnson

262
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:59,072
people from global corporate PR agencies

263
00:19:59,172 --> 00:20:05,622
and health officials from all over the world, including a Chinese

264
00:20:05,722 --> 00:20:11,961
and what were they simulating? they were simulating a pandemic

265
00:20:12,061 --> 00:20:16,238
but they weren't simulating a medical response to that pandemic

266
00:20:16,338 --> 00:20:20,484
they were simulating a militarized response

267
00:20:20,584 --> 00:20:23,265
how do you use that pandemic

268
00:20:23,365 --> 00:20:26,674
to, particularly in Event 201

269
00:20:26,774 --> 00:20:29,455
to impose censorship globally

270
00:20:29,555 --> 00:20:34,569
and that's what they were modelling. And look, particularly in episode 4

271
00:20:34,669 --> 00:20:39,114
it's all about... and oddly, their preoccupation was

272
00:20:39,214 --> 00:20:43,779
"how do we stop people from stop talking about the fact"

273
00:20:43,879 --> 00:20:48,684
"that this virus may have been lab generated and released?"

274
00:20:48,784 --> 00:20:54,067
so they're talking about that in October 2019 and I'm not making this up

275
00:20:54,167 --> 00:20:57,535
you can go to the simulation and see this

276
00:20:57,635 --> 00:21:03,157
"how do we shut these people up?". George Gao, the head of the

277
00:21:03,257 --> 00:21:08,540
Chinese CDC is saying "we need to stop people from talking about that issue"

278
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:17,392
but as I looked at that issue I found there was another one called SPARS where they did the same thing

279
00:21:17,492 --> 00:21:24,270
they're not talking about how do you quarantine the sick and care for them

280
00:21:24,370 --> 00:21:29,264
instead they're "how do you lock down the healthy", something that's never been done in history

281
00:21:29,364 --> 00:21:36,082
"how do you force people to wear masks? how do you force people to comply with forced isolation?"

282
00:21:36,182 --> 00:21:40,807
"how do you bring in the military, how do you silence all dissent?"

283
00:21:40,907 --> 00:21:47,715
They weren't talking about how do you get people to take vitamin D, and how do you build your immune system, and tell them

284
00:21:47,815 --> 00:21:53,157
to lose weight, to exercise --- 80% of the people who died were overweight

285
00:21:53,257 --> 00:22:00,155
and it was probably a lot more than that because they were counting people who died from lightning strikes and car crashes

286
00:22:00,255 --> 00:22:07,900
and how do you develop therapeutic drugs, off-the-shelf therapeutic drugs

287
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,472
most obvious thing to do

288
00:22:10,572 --> 00:22:20,699
to create a communication system among the world's 11 million doctors, people on the front-line treating the disease

289
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:27,517
so that every successful treatment protocol is called in, other people are given the opportunity 

290
00:22:27,617 --> 00:22:31,644
to repeat it

291
00:22:31,744 --> 00:22:38,552
and then ways to assess which ones are working and which ones aren't and do really rapid

292
00:22:38,652 --> 00:22:42,051
placebo control trials in hospitals all over the world

293
00:22:42,151 --> 00:22:47,972
and to create field clinics where you're treating people who are not sick but are infected

294
00:22:48,072 --> 00:22:50,574
and never have to go to the hospital

295
00:22:50,674 --> 00:22:55,328
and develop protocols so they never have to leave their homes

296
00:22:55,428 --> 00:22:58,917
you want to avoid hospitalizations

297
00:22:59,017 --> 00:23:03,223
one because that's the reason they gave to shut down society

298
00:23:03,323 --> 00:23:07,709
two if you can treat somebody before they leave their home

299
00:23:07,809 --> 00:23:13,062
every time somebody leaves their home who is sick, and go into the hospital really sick

300
00:23:13,162 --> 00:23:16,022
that is a super-spreader event

301
00:23:16,122 --> 00:23:24,306
that person is spreading the disease to Uber drivers, to doctors, to nurses, to family members, to people on the street

302
00:23:24,406 --> 00:23:27,326
you wanna treat them at home

303
00:23:27,426 --> 00:23:31,513
give them the things we know kill viral replication

304
00:23:31,613 --> 00:23:36,267
zinc and anything that enhances zinc like hydroxychloroquine, ivermectin and

305
00:23:36,367 --> 00:23:40,514
a hundred other remedies that we now know

306
00:23:40,614 --> 00:23:45,777
dramatically reduce the spread of this disease. And what was our protocol?

307
00:23:45,877 --> 00:23:51,608
Our protocol was to do none of that. No treatment until you go to the hospital

308
00:23:51,708 --> 00:23:55,765
Then your treatment are two things that are bound to kill you:

309
00:23:55,865 --> 00:23:58,427
ventilators and remdesivir

310
00:23:58,527 --> 00:24:02,673
And Tony Fauci knew that remdesivir would kill you

311
00:24:02,773 --> 00:24:09,401
He knew that because in 2019 he tried to use it for Ebola, 2019

312
00:24:09,501 --> 00:24:12,601
He tried to use it for Ebola and within

313
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:19,180
5 days of treatment it gave lethal side-effect to 54% of the people. The safety monitoring board

314
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:23,307
ordered him to terminate the use of that drug

315
00:24:23,407 --> 00:24:27,135
He threw a phony, contrived

316
00:24:27,235 --> 00:24:32,727
absolute fraudulent study that he manipulated and orchestrated of that drug

317
00:24:32,827 --> 00:24:36,644
made it standard of care. It is homicide

318
00:24:36,744 --> 00:24:42,505
And if you look, how does it kill people? Two ways... Three ways

319
00:24:42,605 --> 00:24:48,277
kidney failure, heart failure and all-organ collapse

320
00:24:48,377 --> 00:24:54,617
and what happened to the people who died in the pandemic, what were they dying of? Kidney failure

321
00:24:54,717 --> 00:25:01,405
All the doctors said, you heard it again and again: we've never seen a virus that attacks the kidneys

322
00:25:01,505 --> 00:25:06,309
Because it wasn't the virus. It was the Remdesivir

323
00:25:06,409 --> 00:25:10,885
and he denied them deliberately, purposefully

324
00:25:10,985 --> 00:25:17,224
access to the things that we know work because 248 studies show they do

325
00:25:17,324 --> 00:25:22,607
which is Ivermecting and hydroxychloroquine. And all the others, even monoclonal

326
00:25:22,707 --> 00:25:30,951
steroids antibodies which they know work, they denied to all the people in the nursing home when they could've given it to them

327
00:25:31,051 --> 00:25:36,214
so, something about this smelled

328
00:25:36,314 --> 00:25:43,839
it was suspecious and weird from the beginning. What I found during the course of my research

329
00:25:43,939 --> 00:25:52,930
is that those simulations were not just confined to Event 201 and to SPARS

330
00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:57,386
I found out over a dozen of them

331
00:25:57,486 --> 00:26:03,247
and they did at least once every two years beginning in 2000

332
00:26:03,347 --> 00:26:06,088
most of them were top secret

333
00:26:06,188 --> 00:26:09,886
but they involved hundreds of thousands of people

334
00:26:09,986 --> 00:26:13,415
They were doing these simulation with

335
00:26:13,515 --> 00:26:19,246
all of the police forces, many of the big city police forces in our contry

336
00:26:19,346 --> 00:26:23,642
with front-line doctors and nurses

337
00:26:23,742 --> 00:26:32,314
with medical officials, with the big corporate officials, from the energy industry, from the medical cartels, from the pharmaceutical industry

338
00:26:32,414 --> 00:26:35,454
And they were involving not just the United States

339
00:26:35,554 --> 00:26:42,870
Canada, Mexico and all of the nations of Europe were all participating, secretly

340
00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:47,386
and drilling this again, again and again

341
00:26:47,486 --> 00:26:50,765
if you look at 

342
00:26:50,865 --> 00:26:56,566
the techniques that they were using, here's something that they have in common

343
00:26:56,666 --> 00:27:01,082
virtually every one of those simulations involved

344
00:27:01,182 --> 00:27:04,252
representatives from the CIA

345
00:27:04,352 --> 00:27:12,745
and the scripts for them were written by people associated with the intelligence agencies

346
00:27:12,845 --> 00:27:17,290
almost all of them had a well-known

347
00:27:17,390 --> 00:27:21,058
American or European leader

348
00:27:21,158 --> 00:27:26,770
heads of Denmark, Sweden, Sam Nunn,

349
00:27:26,870 --> 00:27:33,648
Madeleine Albright, Gary Hart, would be at the head of them

350
00:27:33,748 --> 00:27:39,419
and that gave them kind of an imprimatur of gravitas and legitimacy

351
00:27:39,519 --> 00:27:47,015
all of these front-line workers were being asked to do weird things, not cure patients

352
00:27:47,115 --> 00:27:51,830
but censor people. They all now have in their head

353
00:27:51,930 --> 00:27:56,345
"this is what you do in a pandemic. This is a legitimate"

354
00:27:56,445 --> 00:28:00,681
"way to respond to a pandemic. This is the <i>only</i> way to respond"

355
00:28:00,781 --> 00:28:05,376
It's not to make people better, it's not to treat their illnesses

356
00:28:05,476 --> 00:28:10,580
it's not to keep them alive, it's the clamp down to totalitarian controls

357
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:16,202
I wrote a book about my family's 60 year battle with the CIA

358
00:28:16,302 --> 00:28:20,538
called American Values, and researching that

359
00:28:20,638 --> 00:28:27,804
I went out and purchased, at great cost, some of them cost me thousads of dollars

360
00:28:27,904 --> 00:28:31,483
the CIA manuals for

361
00:28:31,583 --> 00:28:35,550
manipulating large populations, and

362
00:28:35,650 --> 00:28:40,364
they wrote a series of manuals for the techniques that are useful

363
00:28:40,464 --> 00:28:44,312
when the intelligence agencies want to go into...

364
00:28:44,412 --> 00:28:47,930
or other foreign policy panjandrums,

365
00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:51,010
wanna go into an indigenous society

366
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:53,791
to destroy local businesses

367
00:28:53,891 --> 00:28:58,785
to isolate and destroy institutional structures

368
00:28:58,885 --> 00:29:03,062
to destroy social structures and social relationships

369
00:29:03,162 --> 00:29:08,295
to obliterate the economy, to create chaos

370
00:29:08,395 --> 00:29:13,708
that will then create enough people in the country who will allow

371
00:29:13,808 --> 00:29:18,941
a foreign entity to come in and clamp down centralized control

372
00:29:19,041 --> 00:29:24,892
and almost all of the techniques that are outlined in those manuals

373
00:29:24,992 --> 00:29:28,809
are the same techniques that they were practicing in these simulations

374
00:29:28,909 --> 00:29:33,026
year after year after year with hundreds of thousands of people

375
00:29:33,126 --> 00:29:39,066
and for example in the CIA manual, the CIA conducted

376
00:29:39,166 --> 00:29:42,505
these well-known

377
00:29:42,605 --> 00:29:49,234
programs called by various name, operation ARTICHOKE, MK-ULTRA, etc

378
00:29:49,334 --> 00:29:52,344
in the late 50s, 60s and 70s

379
00:29:54,198 --> 00:30:00,867
to develop ways of manipulating human beings on an individual basis and on a mass basis

380
00:30:00,967 --> 00:30:09,030
and the most potent technique, incidentally, that they learned again, again and again, more potent than physical torture

381
00:30:09,130 --> 00:30:15,639
was isolation. If you can isolate people, and they did this

382
00:30:15,739 --> 00:30:20,962
with sensory deprivation tanks, but also locking people in solitary confinement

383
00:30:21,062 --> 00:30:27,003
you can get them to do almost anything you want them after a certain period of time. It will drive them mad

384
00:30:27,103 --> 00:30:29,993
because we're social animals, we're social beings

385
00:30:30,093 --> 00:30:35,675
and when you tear this social fabric it makes people desperate, fearful

386
00:30:35,775 --> 00:30:41,656
and obedient to do anything. Another technique is called Stockholm syndrome

387
00:30:41,756 --> 00:30:47,577
which is a way of putting individuals

388
00:30:47,677 --> 00:30:52,661
or large parts of humanity in lockdown, for long periods of time

389
00:30:52,761 --> 00:30:56,997
and it induces a kind of mass psychosis

390
00:30:57,097 --> 00:31:03,397
makes them grateful to their captors, makes them empathize with their captors

391
00:31:03,497 --> 00:31:07,194
renders them obedient, believing that obedience

392
00:31:07,294 --> 00:31:11,740
is the only path to salvation, absolute obedience

393
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:15,538
and it obliterates, again, critical thinking

394
00:31:15,638 --> 00:31:22,087
but during this period, the CIA was funding

395
00:31:22,187 --> 00:31:27,828


396
00:31:27,928 --> 00:31:33,211


397
00:31:33,311 --> 00:31:38,444


398
00:31:38,544 --> 00:31:43,708


399
00:31:43,808 --> 00:31:50,167


400
00:31:50,267 --> 00:31:54,354


401
00:31:54,454 --> 00:31:58,391


402
00:31:58,491 --> 00:32:04,461


403
00:32:04,561 --> 00:32:10,263


404
00:32:10,363 --> 00:32:15,795


405
00:32:15,895 --> 00:32:21,895


406
00:32:21,995 --> 00:32:27,398


407
00:32:27,498 --> 00:32:32,691


408
00:32:32,791 --> 00:32:38,253


409
00:32:38,353 --> 00:32:41,662


410
00:32:41,762 --> 00:32:46,028


411
00:32:46,128 --> 00:32:53,355


412
00:32:53,455 --> 00:32:59,096


413
00:32:59,196 --> 00:33:03,133


414
00:33:03,233 --> 00:33:08,307


415
00:33:08,407 --> 00:33:12,703


416
00:33:12,803 --> 00:33:17,936


417
00:33:18,036 --> 00:33:22,511
